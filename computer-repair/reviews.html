        <p class="a1">It totally depends upon you! But to give you a little more perks about us, We are dedicated only to the compatibility of PC Parts for the best profit of our users. We always update our system so that you will only get the best and the latest parts available in the market.</p>
        <p class="a2">Our system works by testing various compatibilities of every component with other selected pc parts by the user, and to achieve such a big goal. We have written thousands of lines of the algorithms just to make sure you will always get what's compatible and the latest for your build.</p>
        <p class="a3">Our Millions of satisfied users is our proof of the trust towards them. We are here just for helping the people who wish to make their own pc build, but they lack the proper knowledge of the components and their compatibilities. So they get messed up with their build, but with us, they didn't need to worry anymore.</p>
        <p class="a4">Yes, of course, you can showcase your build with us, just signup in our system and submit your build and we are more than happy to feature your build on PC Builder, and we just love to see people building their PC builds with the help of our system and keeping their trust in us.</p>
        <p class="a5">We are currently working with Amazon LLC as our only merchant because Amazon is the one-stop for everything, and it assures the availability of all components. Most of us love to buy all the parts from one place rather than searching them on different platforms.</p>
